      <p class="info">Mayor Dana Cardinal announced that last night’s air raid sirens were nothing to be alarmed by. Nor are the missing street and highway signs, nor are the angry people who were assigned to hold the signs and wave them about, using the maritime telegraphic language of semaphore, and who are now standing around dumbfounded and empty-handed. Nor should we yet concern ourselves with mailboxes, which have all been filled with what postal workers hope is just hair gel.
      <br>
      Following a meeting with the sheriff and the City Council, Mayor Cardinal says she believes this all to be the work of pranksters – perhaps the return of the feral dogs, who once defaced several concrete walls with libertarian street art – but the mayor and the Secret Police are not ruling out more sinister activity.
      <br>
      Sheriff Sam added, while whittling a piece of balsa into a polar bear, that it’s “definitely these foreigners, moving here from Desert Bluffs.”</p>
